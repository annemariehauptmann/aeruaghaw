                            <p> Thinking about getting the Garmin Dashcam 45 but as I have a Windows phone I'm not sure if this supports the app; smart phones often means iOS or Andriod, not Windows. I had a look on my phone and it only comes up with a Garmin HUD app, however, most online sources seem to mention there should be a Garmin VIRB app, of which I cannot find. Is it nessicary to have the app and is it compatible with Windows phone. So today my Band 2, that I bought in November, died. It had been having problems lately, like just turning off whenever it wanted. Then today, it just wouldn't hold a charge. While it worked though it was GREAT. I loved the sync with my L950. Perfect for running and guided workouts. In its place, the Microsoft Store gave me a 5 gift card. I could use it to get a Fitbit I suppose. (seeing that It's the only thing in the store I could use my gift card for to replace it. How is life after. So I am frequently running trails off road and am looking for a nice mobile radio setup to install in my truck. The goal is to broadcast my location live to others in the group or someone back home, as well as see others in my off road group who are also broadcasting, on a map. If I can somehow use the setup for general off road navigation as well, that would be a plus. I have an FTM-100DR installed currently but have been looking deeper into the different APRS options out there that will provi. 
Feel free to debate my choices but if you do so, please mention why you would use an alternative app instead. Sharing is caring! _____________________________ NB! I am obviously in no way affiliated with any of the developers of these apps. This post is purely just me giving back to the this community for their own recommendations. _____________________________ Without further ado. Here is a list of the 50 most important apps that I use: 17Track (https://play.google.com/store/apps/de. So a little backstory. I am indeed an addict, been sober for a few years now, have a stable, well paying job and have been doing really really well for myself all things considered. So earlier this week I buy my mother a “new to her” car (a 1998 Honda Accord) that is in PRISTINE condition. One owner throughout its life, kept in a garage, always had its oil changed at 3k miles, etc. etc. So I had it registered and insured this past Friday and today I swing by mom’s house to install. Hi all, I am currently one of the few remaining users of a Windows 10 Mobile device, the Lumia 950 XL. To be honest I have held on so long because I have not been so enamoured by any previous devices. The main reasons I love the 950 XL are: Large OLED screen in a pretty small form factor Great camera and exceptionally bright flashlight Dark theme throughout the whole OS Double tap to wake Amazing call quality and noise cancellation SD card support and headphone jack Altho. It is raining UWP apps in the windows 10 store right now. 1800-Flowers! ( PicsArt Studio! ( Pandora in Desktop Now! ( NBC Breaking Let me be clear that I'm not trying to start a flame war or disparage WP. I've been a long time user and I'm still a supporter of the platform but I decided that my needs would be better served elsewhere and felt that this review would be useful here. Edit: An update was released about two days ago that fixed several of these problems. I'll strike-through and mark which problems were fixed. Currently on Version 1511, OS build 10.0.10586.107, firmware 01078.00038.16025.39004. I’ve. So, I finally upgraded my Lumia 435 to the current build of Win10 from 8.1. I was happy with 8.1, but an app I need (Garmin Connect) is only available for 10. This is my first encounter with Windows 10 Mobile and I am quite disappointed. I of course realise this is still a beta, and I accept a few things don't quite work perfectly yet - but there are a few things which I simply can't understand. Windows 8.1 had wonderful UI. There was something aesthetically pleasing about big lowercase titles. </p>
